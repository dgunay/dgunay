### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devin. Some interesting facts about me:

- Traumatic amounts of Perl experience
- Physically hurt myself with code I've written (kids, don't do audio programming with headphones on unless you know what you're doing)
- I move between Rust and Go depending on what I need and haven't written a single blog post about it
- Recovered PHP evangelist
