### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devin. I do software engineering. 

I currently work at [Yendo ðŸ’³ðŸš™](https://www.yendo.com/). Have worked at:

* [Feedonomics ðŸ›’](https://feedonomics.com/)
* [The Aerospace Corporation ðŸš€](https://aerospace.org/)
* [Maestro Interactive ðŸ“º](https://www.maestro.io/)

Here are some articles and works that I feel strongly embody my values as a programmer:

* [Dan Luu - Culture Matters](https://danluu.com/culture/)
* There's not exactly one work I can point, but perhaps [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)
